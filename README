DocuSign Web Services API 2011 SDK
===========================================================================

The DocuSign Web Services API provides methods that allow developers to
integrate the DocuSign service into their applications. By building
DocuSign into existing applications, those applications gain the ability to
gather electronic signatures and data.  

Transactions are completely defined on the host application side by
generating XML  envelopes  that contain a PDF and the XML signing
instructions. Because the transactions could be defined on the fly by the
host application, the workflow and processing can be completely defined by
the developer.
 
The service allows developers to build solutions that are able to perform
the following:
-	Send documents for signature through the web service from host
	applications either one at a time, or as a group in an electronic
	envelope
-	Define the authentication required to sign or access the envelope
	including 3 different types, or pass through authentication from
	the host application
-	Define the signature locations using either static or relative
	signature location descriptions on any page in the document
-	Define data field locations, masks, and if they are optional or
	required, and if they contain pre-populated data if those fields
	are locked or editable.
-	Assign specific signing tasks or data fields to specific
	individuals
-	Support embedded signing where the signing process is invoked with
	a token that allows the signing to be embedded in an iframe of a
	host application
-	Support remote signing where the signing process generates an email
	to return to sign
-	Select the workflow the  routing of signing  either in parallel or
	in serial or a combination
-	Submit completely specified envelopes that are immediately
	processed for delivery. 
-	Submit partially specified envelopes for later completion by the
	customer.
-	Void an envelope that has been submitted but not yet completed.
-	Retrieve the status of an envelope including sent, signed, voided,
	forwarded, etc.
-	Retrieve the digitally signed completed PDF of every document in an
	envelope.
-	Retrieve the completed PDF for each separate document in an
	envelope.
-	Retrieve the e-sign status of a recipient.
-	Retrieve the certificate and audit log of the transaction
-	Transfer an envelope to another DocuSign user or account.
-	Correct recipient information for an existing envelope.
-	Resend a notification email to an existing recipient.
-	Correct the workflow for envelopes have already been submitted
-	Retrieve the Member level permissions for the optional features.
-	 Turn on or off the envelope ID stamp
-	Retrieve data entered by signers filling in the data fields. 
-	Submit documents for signature without any signing tabs at all,
	which invokes a freeform signing process that the recipient will
	follow to place signatures
-	Specify electronic vaulting for Envelopes.
-	Extract and remove original copies of documents from the DocuSign
	systems.
